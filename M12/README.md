#Lecture
##Meeting 11 - More External Modules - Matpotlib for plotting data, 
##### Today we will discuss how to use Matplotlib for plotting vector and raster data.

1. Test next week.
  1. There will be a short test week.  
  2. Most of it will be looking at code snippets and interpreting what is happening.  
  3. The test will be open notes / open computers.
  4. Should take less than an hour.
  5. The rest of the time will be devoted to answering questions about labs / projects.
1. There are many external modules for python that can be useful in GIS.
  1. Flask - A web server
  2. psycop2 - interface with database
  3. Scipy - do scientific operations
  4. numpy - arrays
  5. and many more.
2. matplotlib is a powerful library for plotting data (http://matplotlib.org/)
  1. Plots arrays (or array like objects such as python lists)
  2. Sometimes arrays have to be manipulated to be the correct dimensions.
  3. Often best start with an example and modify to what you want to do.
    1. Histograms
	2. Scatter Plot
  
#Lab 

Here is your assignment (You have two weeks to finish this assignment).

1. Create script that makes a histogram of any one of the statistics you generated from the vector lab (metrics of shape for cities of mississippi)
  1. Tell me about the distribution of your data. Does that distribution look normal?
  2. Your script should report the mean and standard dev of the data. (There are already numpy array methods for calculating these values).
2. Make a scatter plot of any two of the GOM datasets from Meeting 10.
